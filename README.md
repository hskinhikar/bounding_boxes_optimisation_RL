# Bounding Boxes Optimization Using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This repository is focused on refining ship detection in satellite imagery by optimizing the outlines generated by a Mask R-CNN model through the application of reinforcement learning (RL). The project initially explored several methods for ship classification, but the strategy evolved into using reinforcement learning to fine-tune the bounding polygons produced by the model. The primary objective is to use RL to adjust these polygons so that they more accurately match manually created ground truth polygons, enhancing the precision and accuracy of the modelâ€™s outputs.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Reinforcement Learning Implementation**
   - **Description:** The current folder contains the core scripts related to the reinforcement learning process. It includes everything from the environment setup to the training and evaluation of the RL model.
   - **Key Files:**
     - `reinforcement_learning_script.py`: The main script for setting up the RL environment and executing the training process using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). This script is responsible for adjusting polygon vertices in real time, using feedback from the environment to improve alignment with the ground truth.
     - `Reinforcement_learning_explanation.md`: Explains the specific application of reinforcement learning within this project, including the design of the custom RL environment and the training methodology.
     - 'agent_actively_moving_vertices.mp4': Real-time visualisation of the agent carrying out an actions based on reward.

### 2. **Ship Outline Generation**
   - **Description:** This sub-folder contains scripts and resources for generating the initial ship outlines using the Mask R-CNN model. It includes various utilities to handle and process polygon data, ensuring they are prepared for the reinforcement learning phase.
   - **Key Files:**
     - `problem_statement_refinement.pdf`: Details the project's development, from initial ideas to the current reinforcement learning strategy.
     - `drawing_bounding_boxes.py`: Generates initial bounding boxes around ships in satellite images using the Mask R-CNN model.
     - `multiple_verticed_polygons_displayed.py`: Adjusts predicted polygons to have a consistent number of vertices, which is necessary for the RL process.
     - `both_polygons_displayed.py`: Selects the highest-confidence polygon and displays it alongside the ground truth for further processing.
     - `gen_predicted_grndreality_polygons.py`: Prepares the predicted and ground truth polygons for use in the reinforcement learning framework.
