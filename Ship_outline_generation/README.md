# Ship Outline Generation and Problem Statement Refinement

## Overview

This folder is part of a project focused on enhancing the detection and outlining of ships in satellite imagery through reinforcement learning (RL). Initially, the project aimed to refine a ship classification model by directing its focus to specific regions within an image. However, the approach evolved into optimizing the ship outlines generated by a Mask R-CNN model. This folder contains scripts that reflect the iterative development of the problem statement and the necessary resources to support the reinforcement learning process.

## Contents

- **problem_statement_refinement.pdf**: This document details the evolution of the problem statement, from initial concepts involving attention mechanisms and bounding boxes to the current approach of applying reinforcement learning to optimize polygon vertices. It discusses the challenges encountered and the rationale behind the final methodology.

### Scripts

- **`drawing_bounding_boxes.py`**: Uses Mask R-CNN to draw bounding boxes around ships in satellite images.
- **`display_multiple_polygon_predictions_as_is.py`**: Displays multiple predicted polygons alongside ground truth and processed input images, highlighting the performance of the initial predictions.
- **`multiple_verticed_polygons_displayed.py`**: Adjusts the predicted polygons to ensure each has exactly eight vertices, facilitating the subsequent reinforcement learning process.
- **`both_polygons_displayed.py`**: Selects and displays only the highest-confidence polygon alongside the ground truth, simplifying the focus for reinforcement learning.
- **`gen_predicted_grndreality_polygons.py`**: Generates and prepares the initial predicted and ground truth polygons, which are then used as inputs for the reinforcement learning script.
