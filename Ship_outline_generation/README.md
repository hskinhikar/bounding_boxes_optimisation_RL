# Ship Outline Generation and Problem Statement Refinement

## Overview

This folder is part of a project aimed at improving the detection and outlining of ships in satellite imagery using reinforcement learning (RL). The initial goal was to refine a ship classification model by focusing its attention on specific regions of an image. However, the approach evolved to focus on optimizing the outlines of ships generated by a Mask R-CNN model. Reinforcement learning is applied to adjust the vertices of these predicted polygonal outlines so that they more accurately match manually created ground truth polygons.

- **problem_statement_refinement.pdf**: This document outlines the development of the problem statement, describing the initial ideas, the challenges faced, and the final approach adopted. The shift from using attention mechanisms and bounding boxes to applying reinforcement learning directly to polygon vertices is explained in detail.
